# ðŸš¨ Helmet Violation Detection & Number Plate Recognition

This project implements an end-to-end pipeline to automatically detect helmet violations and recognize vehicle number plates from video footage. It leverages deep learning based models (YOLO) to detect violations and computer vision to extract vehicele numbers to ensure road safety and regulatory compliance.

Details about the working and implementation can be found in `interim-report.pdf` and `final-report.pdf`.
